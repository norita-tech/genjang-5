# EDA Diabetes Pima Indiana
An EDA will be conducted on this dataset,so that we can be able to see any trends and correlations within our Data. This will aid us in forming our Hypothesis and subsequently train our Machine Learning models accordingly

## Project Goal (Objective):
The goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether a patient is likely to be diagnosed with diabetes based on diagnostic measurements. The model should take into account features such as glucose level, BMI, age, and others to classify patients into diabetic or non-diabetic categories.

## Motivation:
Diabetes is a chronic condition that can lead to serious health complications if left undetected and untreated. Early prediction enables:

- Preventive care and lifestyle interventions
- Reduction in healthcare costs
- Improved quality of life for at-risk individuals
  
By using machine learning, we aim to:

- Identify patterns in diagnostic data that signal risk of diabetes
- Assist healthcare professionals in decision support
- Gain insights into which features are most predictive of diabetes.rview of our Dataset

**About Our Data set**
This dataset is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. The objective of the dataset is to diagnostically predict
whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements included in the dataset. Several constraints were placed on the selection of these 
instances from a larger database. In particular, all patients here are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

The dataset consist of several medical predictor (independent) variables and one target (dependent) variable, Outcome. Independent variables include the number of 
pregnancies the patient has had, their BMI, insulin level, age, and so od 1 for Diabetic

**Dataset Overview:**

Rows: 768 patients

Columns: 9 features

Target Variable: Outcome (1 = Diabetes, 0 = No Diabetes)

**Columns**
- Pregnancies: Number of times pregnant
- Glucose: Plasma glucose concentration
- BloodPressure: Diastolic blood pressure (mm Hg)
- SkinThickness: Triceps skinfold thickness (mm)
- Insulin: 2-Hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)
- BMI: Body mass index (weight in kg/(height in m)^2)
- DiabetesPedigreeFunction: Diabetes pedigree function
- Age: Age in years
- Outcome: Class variable (0 or 1)
